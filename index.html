      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about_para">
          Hi, my name is Okon Nsikak, but most people know me as Nzilla. I was born and raised in Nigeria and am currently an aspiring software developer pursuing a BSc at BYU-Idaho. Iâ€™m passionate about solving problems, which is why I ventured into software development. It allows me to tackle real-world challenges from anywhere. My family is my greatest source of inspiration, and they keep me motivated even during tough times.
          <br><br>
          When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll likely find me on the football field. Playing football keeps me fit and energized, and I enjoy the camaraderie it brings. Iâ€™m excited to continue growing as a developer and making an impact through technology.

          Nigeria, often referred to as the "Giant of Africa," is a vibrant and diverse country located in West Africa. With a population of over 200 million, it is the most populous country on the continent and boasts over 250 ethnic groups and languages. Nigeria is known for its rich cultural heritage, ranging from colorful festivals to Afrobeat music pioneered by legends like Fela Kuti.
          <br><br>
          The country's economy is one of the largest in Africa, driven by oil production, agriculture, and a growing tech industry often dubbed the "Silicon Savannah." From bustling Lagos to serene landscapes of the Niger Delta, Nigeria is a land of contrasts and opportunities.
