          Hi, my name is Okon Nsikak, but most people know me as Nzilla. I was born and raised in Nigeria and am currently an aspiring software developer pursuing a BSc at BYU-Idaho. I’m passionate about solving problems, which is why I ventured into software development. It allows me to tackle real-world challenges from anywhere. My family is my greatest source of inspiration, and they keep me motivated even during tough times.
          <br><br>
          When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me on the football field. Playing football keeps me fit and energized, and I enjoy the camaraderie it brings. I’m excited to continue growing as a developer and making an impact through technology.
